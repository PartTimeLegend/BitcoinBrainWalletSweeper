ANNOUNCEMENT
============

Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.

I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.

It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.

Okay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)

Bitcoin Brain Wallet Address Sweeper
====================================

As many people are using Brain Wallets they should make sure to diversify their investments.

As a result of this I have been creating a system to import a CSV containing these passwords and then calculate the Public/Private Keys.

Please don't use this for anything bad, it's not my fault if you do.
