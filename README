Bitcoin Brain Wallet Address Sweeper
====================================

As many people are using Brain Wallets they should make sure to diversify their investments.

As a result of this I have been creating a system to import a CSV containing these passwords and then calculate the Public/Private Keys.

Please don't use this for anything bad, it's not my fault if you do.
