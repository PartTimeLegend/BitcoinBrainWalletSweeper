I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBitcoin Brain Wallet Address Sweeper\r\n====================================\r\n\r\nAs many people are using Brain Wallets they should make sure to diversify their investments.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this I have been creating a system to import a CSV containing these passwords and then calculate the Public/Private Keys.\r\n\r\nPlease don't use this for anything bad, it's not my fault if you do.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Donations go to: [11kbQe1K6a6JeLwedMLikC4XrmnBCQ8eo](bitcoin:11kbQe1K6a6JeLwedMLikC4XrmnBCQ8eo)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
